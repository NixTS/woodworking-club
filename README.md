Live Website: [Woodworking Club](https://nixts.github.io/woodworking-club/index.html)

## Purpose
Woodworking Club is a comprehensive site that provides information for individuals interested in woodworking and socializing with like-minded woodworking enthusiasts. Woodworking Club offers a diverse range of services, including beginner-courses, open workshops and exclusive member events, all under the guidance of highly skilled and experianced woodworking professionals.

With a primary focus on fostering a vibrant woodworking community, our platform appeals to seasoned craftsmen, as well as individuals with a keen interest in woodworking but limited prior experience.

At its core, this website in its current state, aims to attract new and interested members while also seeking potential donations and partnerships to keep Woodworking Club alive and thriving.
